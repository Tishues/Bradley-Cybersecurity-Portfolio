# Bradley-Cybersecurity-Portfolio
## Freelance Web Application Penetration Tester

Hi, Iâ€™m Brad â€” an aspiring **penetration tester** with a strong foundation in **Python programming** and a growing track record in **hands-on security labs**. This portfolio showcases my practical projects, learning journey, and the skills I bring to real-world security challenges.

---

## TryHackMe Learning Experience
Iâ€™ve completed a wide range of interactive labs and hands-on rooms on TryHackMe that have developed my practical skills in web application testing, infrastructure exploitation, and cybersecurity fundamentals.

### Web Application Exploitation
Gained hands-on experience identifying and exploiting common vulnerabilities in modern web applications, following OWASP Top 10 principles and manual testing techniques.

**Key rooms:**
- **Authentication Bypass** â€“ Exploited broken login logic and weak session management.
- **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)** â€“ Accessed unauthorized data by manipulating URL parameters.
- **SQL Injection** â€“ Injected malicious queries to bypass login and extract data.
- **Command Injection** â€“ Executed OS-level commands via insecure input handling.
- **File Inclusion** â€“ Discovered and exploited LFI/RFI vulnerabilities to access sensitive files.
- **Intro to SSRF** â€“ Used internal server requests to access protected resources.
- **Intro to Cross-site Scripting** â€“ Injected scripts to hijack sessions and modify page behavior.
- **Content Discovery** â€“ Found hidden files and endpoints through forced browsing.
- **Subdomain Enumeration** â€“ Uncovered additional targets via DNS and subdomain fuzzing.
- **Walking an Application** â€“ Mapped out application logic, user flows, and input points.
- **Burp Suite: The Basics** â€“ Intercepted and modified HTTP requests to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Putting it All Together** â€“ Connected web components into a full exploitation workflow.
- **How Websites Work** â€“ Built foundational understanding of frontend/backend interaction.

### Supporting Skills â€“ Infrastructure & Exploitation
Built complementary skills to support web testing by exploring Linux privilege escalation and Active Directory enumeration.

**Key rooms:**
- **Linux Privilege Escalation** â€“ Identified misconfigurations (e.g., SUID, writable files, sudo abuse) to gain root access.
- **Active Directory: Basic Enumeration** â€“ Explored AD structures and queried users, groups, and shares.
- **Race Conditions** â€“ Demonstrated timing-based attacks to exploit concurrency vulnerabilities.

### Foundational Knowledge
Strengthened understanding of networks, protocols, and system design to support more effective testing and report writing.

**Key topics covered:**
- OSI model, LAN design, TCP/IP fundamentals
- Packets vs. frames and data transmission
- NAT, port forwarding, and basic routing

> I continue to grow my skills through hands-on labs, vulnerable machine walkthroughs, and real-world scenarios focused on offensive security.

## Walkthroughs & Writeups
Real-world practice and analysis of vulnerable machines and challenges.

- **Linux Privilege Escalation â€“ TryHackMe**  
  Explored misconfigurations like writable `/etc/passwd`, abused SUID binaries, and leveraged `sudo` misuses to escalate privileges on a Linux machine.

## Python Projects
In addition to hands-on security labs, Iâ€™ve built small Python projects to develop my scripting skills â€” useful for automating recon, analyzing data, and testing attack surfaces.
- **Static Site Generator**  
  Converts markdown to HTML; useful for testing web server configs & static site vulnerabilities.  
  [ðŸ”— View Repo](https://github.com/Tishues/static_site_generator)

- **Maze Solver**  
  Navigates a text-based maze using pathfinding algorithms; demonstrates pathfinding and logic.  
  [ðŸ”— View Repo](https://github.com/Tishues/Maze-Solver)
  
- **BookBot**  
  Analyzes book text for word frequencies and patterns; applies text parsing & frequency analysis.  
  [ðŸ”— View Repo](https://github.com/Tishues/bookbot)

- **Asteroids Game**  
  Python clone of the classic arcade game using Pygame; shows object-oriented design & real-time logic.

## Offensive Security Toolkit
### Web App Testing Tools
- **Burp Suite** â€“ Used Proxy, Repeater, and Intruder to intercept and manipulate HTTP traffic
- **Gobuster, FFUF** â€“ For directory brute-forcing and content discovery
- **Wfuzz** â€“ Parameter fuzzing to uncover hidden functionalities
- **Sublist3r, Dig** â€“ For DNS and subdomain enumeration
- **cURL, Postman** â€“ Manual testing of HTTP requests and APIs
- **Browser DevTools** â€“ Analyzing frontend behavior and debugging requests
### Exploitation & Enumeration
- **Netcat** â€“ For reverse shells and port listening
- **LinPEAS, sudo, SUID techniques** â€“ Linux privilege escalation
- **Enum4linux** â€“ Enumerating SMB shares and Active Directory
- **Nmap** â€“ Service discovery and vulnerability scanning
- **Wireshark** â€“ Packet inspection for deeper network analysis
- **Python** â€“ Custom scripts for automation, payload crafting, and recon; see my [Python Projects](#python-projects).
### Environment & Workflow
- **Linux CLI** â€“ Daily driver; comfortable with shell navigation and scripting
- **Git & GitHub** â€“ Version control and project tracking
- **VS Code** â€“ Primary code editor for scripting and analysis
