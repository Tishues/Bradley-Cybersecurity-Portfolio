# Bradley-Cybersecurity-Portfolio
**Entry-Level Penetration Tester | Cybersecurity**

Hi, Iâ€™m Brad â€” an aspiring **penetration tester** with a strong foundation in **Python programming** and a growing track record in **hands-on security labs**. This portfolio showcases my practical projects, learning journey, and the skills I bring to real-world security challenges.

## TryHackMe Learning Experience

Iâ€™ve completed a wide range of interactive labs and hands-on rooms on TryHackMe that helped develop my practical skills in cybersecurity.

### Reconnaissance & Enumeration
Developed hands-on experience gathering intelligence and mapping targets using both passive and active techniques.
**Key rooms:**
- Passive Reconnaissance â€“ Practiced gathering OSINT and DNS data without touching the target.
- Active Reconnaissance â€“ Used Nmap, Gobuster, and enumeration scripts to discover services and directories.
- DNS in Detail**, **HTTP in Detail â€“ Deep-dived into common protocols used during recon.
- Walking An Application â€“ Learned how to explore and map out how a website functions, including pages, inputs, and backend behavior.
- Content Discovery â€“ Uncovered hidden pages, files, and folders that could expose sensitive information.
- Subdomain Enumeration â€“ Identified additional subdomains like test sites or admin panels that could be exploited.

### Privilege Escalation
Learned to identify and exploit common privilege escalation paths on Linux systems and introductory AD environments.
**Key rooms:**
- Linux Privilege Escalation â€“ Used tools like LinPEAS to find misconfigurations and elevate access.
- Active Directory: Basic Enumeration â€“ Practiced identifying AD objects and using tools like BloodHound (basic level).

### Pentesting Fundamentals
Built a strong foundation in offensive security concepts and methodologies.
**Key rooms:**
- Offensive Security Introduction â€“ Covered core concepts of ethical hacking, attack phases, and the offensive mindset.
- Pentesting Fundamentals â€“ Learned the stages of penetration testing and how to approach real-world security assessments.
- Vulnerabilities 101 â€“ Learned to identify and categorize common vulnerabilities in real systems.
- How Websites Work â€“ Learned how websites are structured and served, including frontend/backend basics.
- Putting it All Together â€“ Connected web components (HTTP, DNS, servers, databases) into a full workflow.
- SQL Injection â€“ Practiced detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws in login forms and data queries.

### Foundational Knowledge
Strengthened understanding of how networks, systems, and security careers are structured.
**Key rooms:**
- What is Networking? â€“ Covered TCP/IP, subnets, ports, and protocols.
- Defensive Security Introduction â€“ Explored defensive tools and blue team concepts.
- Careers in Cyber â€“ Gained awareness of different paths and roles in cybersecurity.

> I'm continuing to expand my skill set through hands-on labs, real-world scenarios, and vulnerable machine walkthroughs.
